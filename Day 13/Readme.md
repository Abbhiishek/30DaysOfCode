<h2> Loops </h2>
<p> Loops are used to repeat a block of code. </p>

<h4> For Loop </h4>
<p> The for loop is used to iterate over a list of items. </p>
<p> The syntax is: </p>
<pre>
for item in list:
    # do something
</pre>
<p> The for loop will execute the code inside the loop for each item in the list. </p>
<p> The for loop is useful when you want to do something with each item in a list. </p>
<p> The for loop is also useful when you want to iterate over a range of numbers. </p>
<p> The syntax is: </p>
<pre>
for item in range(start, end):
    # do something
</pre>

<h4> While Loop </h4>
<p> The while loop is used to iterate over a list of items. </p>
<p> The syntax is: </p>
<pre>
while condition:
    # do something
</pre>
<p> The while loop will execute the code inside the loop while the condition is true. </p>
<p> The while loop is useful when you want to do something with each item in a list. </p>
<p> The while loop is also useful when you want to iterate over a range of numbers. </p>
