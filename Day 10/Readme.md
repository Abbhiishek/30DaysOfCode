<h2>  Python program to check leap year using if statement </h2>

1. The first line uses the print function to display the string "Enter the year to check whether it is leap year or not:".
<br>
2. The second line uses the input function to get input from the user and store it in the variable year.
<br>
3. The next line is the if statement. It checks if the remainder of year divided by 4 is equal to 0. If the remainder is 0, the code in the if block is executed. If the remainder is not 0, the code in the if block is skipped and the code in the else block is executed.
<br>
4. The print function is used to display the string "is a leap year" with the value of year concatenated to it.
<br>
5. The else statement is executed if the if statement is false.
<br>
6. The print function is used to display the string "isn't a leap year" with the value of year concatenated to it.
<br>
Output:
Enter the year to check whether it is leap year or not:
<br>
2000
<br>
2000 is a leap year.
