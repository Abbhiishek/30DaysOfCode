<h3> UnitTest </h3>
<p> UnitTest is a framework for writing and running tests in Python. It is based on the JUnit framework for Java. </p>
<p> The unittest module provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. </p>
<p> The unittest module is not included in the standard library, so you need to import it. </p>

```python
import unittest
```

<p> The unittest module provides a base class, called TestCase, which may be used to create new test cases. </p>
