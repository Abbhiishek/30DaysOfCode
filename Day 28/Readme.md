## Number List Shuffle and Reverse

<p> <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcmxCbXaIAEhMV3?format=png"/> </p>

I took a number list, shuffled it, and reversed it. I used the `random` module to shuffle the list, and the `reversed` function to reverse it. 

<h3> Full Explanation </h3>

```
1. We first create a list with 10 numbers.
2. Then we print the list before using the shuffle method.
3. We then shuffle the list using the shuffle method.
4. We then print the list after using the shuffle method.
5. We then reverse the list using the reverse method.
6. We finally print the list after using the reverse method.
```
