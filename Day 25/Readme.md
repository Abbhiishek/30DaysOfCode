## Array

<p> Array is a collection of similar data types. </p>

<p> Array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. </p>

<p> The elements of an array are accessed via an index. The index of the first element is zero, and the index of the last element is the total number of elements minus one. </p>
