## 30 Days of Code | Scaler


### Introduction

This is a collection of 30 days of code challenges that I made while learning to code for straight 30 days starting August 18.
<br>
<br>


### Why did I participate in this challenge?

I want to cultivate the habit of coding regularly. As with any other discipline, doing something over and over again is what builds skills and coding is no different.

I took a pledge to become **1%** better every day with the rest of the Scaler Community!
